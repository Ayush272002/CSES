# CSES Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to the CSES Problem Set Solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to the problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) written in C++.

## About the CSES Problem Set

The CSES Problem Set is a collection of competitive programming problems designed to help improve problem-solving and algorithmic skills. The problems range from easy to challenging and cover a variety of topics such as:

- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- Mathematics
- String Algorithms
- Geometry

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the problem categories. Each folder contains solutions for the respective category. The structure is as follows:

```
CSES-Solutions/
|-- SortingAndSearching/
|   |-- problem1.cpp
|   |-- problem2.cpp
|-- DynamicProgramming/
|   |-- problem1.cpp
|   |-- problem2.cpp
|-- GraphAlgorithms/
|   |-- problem1.cpp
|   |-- problem2.cpp
|-- Mathematics/
|-- StringAlgorithms/
|-- Geometry/
```

Each solution file is named according to the problem's title or ID for clarity.

## How to Run the Solutions

To run a solution, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`). Navigate to the folder containing the desired solution and compile it with:

```bash
g++ -o solution problem1.cpp
./solution
```

Replace `problem1.cpp` with the actual file name of the solution you want to run.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of C++
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`)
- Familiarity with competitive programming and the CSES platform
